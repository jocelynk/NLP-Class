- LabeledLDA on Freebase to utilize unlabeled dataset
- POS Tagger using Twitter tagged POS using Penn Bank tags
- SVM for learning whether tweet informative capitalized or not
	* features based on capitalization will improve accuracy
//capitalization 	
	To
model unlabeled entities and their possible types, we
apply LabeledLDA (Ramage et al., 2009), constraining
each entityâ€™s distribution over topics based on
its set of possible types according to Freebase

 Additionally we
have shown the benefits of features generated from
T-POS and T-CHUNK in segmenting Named Entities.

POSTagger
Best results - 83% cross validation
Use Alan's data, with maxent

Chunker - 85%
Use Alan's data with maxent

get features from chunker and postagger
run maxent classifier
use viterbi to find best tags
